        My name is Michael, and I am a passionate, self-driven student interested in Theoretical Physics as well as Pure and Applied Mathematics. 
        Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Mathematical Physics at the University of Waterloo. Specific topics focused on through 
        university coursework and self study include both Quantum Theory and General Relativity.

        Travelling has provided me with many novel experiences as I visited new locations around the world. Some of these include Italy,
        England, San Marino, Dubai, and Syria. Each location has unique cultures, exposure to which has educated me in some way or another.
        As a result of travelling, I have collected several photos, some of which are showcased below.

    <p class="outline">
        Using my telescope is one of my favourite hobbies. I have always held a strong interest in cosmology, which has influenced my academic life heavily.
        This interest is what has led me to pursue a degree in mathematical physics.

        Once I take some better photos of Saturn, Jupiter, and the Moon, I will be placing them here.
