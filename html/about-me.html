        My name is Michael Gennari, and I am in my final year of a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematical physics with co-operative education at the
        University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. My interests currently include the nuclear many-body problem, <i>ab initio</i> nuclear theory,
        low-energy quantum chromodyanmics (QCD), chiral effective field theory, particle physics, group theory and machine learning.

            The mathematical physics program at the University of Waterloo is comparable to taking both Honours physics and 
            Honours applied mathematics degrees at the university.

        I have always enjoyed visiting new locations around the world. Academic conferences have provided me a way to travel through work, 
        exposing me to new people, cultures, and environments. Some of my recent travel has taken me to locations such as Japan, for the
        conference on direct reactions with exotic beams in 2018. I also spent approximately 16 months in Vancouver, while working as a 
        researcher in nuclear theory at TRIUMF. <br> <br>
        
        I have also had the pleasure of traveling with my family to locations in Italy, San Marino, and Syria; places I greatly enjoyed. Photos from 
        several of my travel experiences, whether they be for work or pleasure, are shown below.

        Using my telescope is one of my favourite hobbies. I owe my current position of studying physics to my childhood interest
        in astronomy and cosmology. Once I take some better photos of Saturn, Jupiter, and the moon, I will be placing them here.
