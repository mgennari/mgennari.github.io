        My name is Michael Gennari, and I am in my final year of a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematical physics at the
        University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. My interests currently include the nuclear many-body problem, <i>ab initio</i> nuclear theory,
        low-energy quantum chromodyanmics (QCD), chiral effective field theory, particle physics, group theory and machine learning.

            The mathematical physics program at the University of Waterloo is comparable to taking both Honours physics and 
            Honours applied mathematics degrees at the university.

        I have travelled for both pleasure and work, which has provided me with many unique experiences as I visit a variety of
        new environments. Some of the international locations I have visitied include Japan, Italy, San Marino, and Syria.
        I have also spent an extensive amount of time in Vancouver, Canada while working as a researcher in nuclear theory at TRIUMF.
        Each location has unique cultural differences, exposure to which has helped educate me in one way or another.
        As a result of travelling, I have collected several photos, some of which are showcased below.

    <p class="outline">
        Using my telescope is one of my favourite hobbies. I owe my current position in studying physics to my original interest
        in astronomy, which began at a young age.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once I take some better photos of Saturn, Jupiter, and the Moon, I will be placing them here.
